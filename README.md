# Audio Spectrum Analyzer Using LCD Display

This project demonstrates a simple **Audio Spectrum Analyzer** built using an **Arduino Mega 2560** and a **16√ó2 LCD (LCD1602A)**.  
The system captures audio input via an AUX cable, processes it, and displays the signal levels on the LCD in real time.

## üìö Project Overview
The aim of this project is to **visualize audio amplitude/spectrum** using an embedded system.  
It was done as part of the **Microprocessor and Microcontrollers Practice** course at **IIITDM Kurnool**.

## üöÄ How It Works
1. The audio signal from a phone/laptop enters the Arduino via the AUX input.
2. The Arduino samples the input signal and computes its amplitude.
3. The processed data is shown as a spectrum bar/levels on the 16√ó2 LCD.
4. The display updates in real time as the audio changes.

## üì¶ Software
- **Arduino IDE** for uploading the program
- Libraries used:
  - `LiquidCrystal.h` (for controlling the LCD)
  - *(Optional)* FFT library if you extend it to show frequency bins
